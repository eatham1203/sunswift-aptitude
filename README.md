# Sunswift Infotainment – Aptitude Test
Welcome to the Sunswift Infotainment aptitude test! This 'test' is not a stressful, high stakes exam or a strict pass/fail test. 

We are not expecting perfect answers, flawless code, or fully polished solutions.

The purpose of this aptitude test is to understand:
- Your current skill level
- How you think through problems
- Your ability to learn independently
- How you communicate your reasoning
- How you approach messy, real world engineering constraints
- How you write and structure code clearly
- Your attitude toward problem solving and trade-offs
    
You are not being judged on deep technical correctness alone.  
We care far more about:
- your approach,
- your clarity of thought,
- how you explain decisions,
- how you break down a problem,
- and how you structure a small solution.

Mistakes are fine. Imperfect solutions are fine!

The entire test should take **approximately 3–4 hours** in total. There is no penalty for going under or over, spend as much time as you like, we just don't want to take up all your time with this.

## Overview of the test
You will complete **three tasks**, each focusing on a different aspect of software engineering relevant to Sunswift. Please read each question description (inside each folder) in detail before starting the questions.

**1. Telemetry Parsing & Visualisation (Frontend – React)**
You will clean and normalise a messy telemetry dataset, then display key values and create a simple speed-time chart.

This tests:
- Data cleaning
- Working with incomplete/corrupted real world data
- Basic visualisation
- Frontend structure & fundamentals

We've set React as the preferred language for this however feel free to use python/flask if you're only comfortable with this.

---
 **2. Telemetry API (Backend – Node.js + Express)**
You will create two API endpoints: one for uploading telemetry logs and one for returning summary statistics.  

This tests:
- API design
- Input validation
- State management
- Clean backend structure
- Reasoning about data integrity

---
**3. Written Question — Infotainment System Design**
A short written response exploring what makes race car infotainment unique and how to design safe, reliable software under real world constraints.  

This tests:
- Communication
- Systems thinking
- Safety awareness
- UX & UI reasoning
- Real world engineering understanding
