# Question 2
## API (backend / Express & Node.js )
##### Expected time: ~1.5 hours

### Background
Our backend receives batches of telemetry data uploaded periodically from the car.  This data must be validated, stored safely, and summarised so that engineers can quickly inspect the health of the vehicle.

Your task is to implement a small backend module that simulates this behaviour.

Implement your solution in Node.js (Express).

##### Your task:
**1. Implement a POST `/logs/upload` endpoint**
This endpoint should:
- Accept a JSON array of telemetry logs
- Validate each entry
- Store valid entries in memory
- Reject invalid entries with a meaningful error response

Each log entry will have the following intended structure:
``` json
{
  "timestamp": number,        // ms since epoch
  "component": "battery" | "motor" | "gps",
  "value": number
}
```

Your validation should ensure:
- All required fields are present
- Types are correct
- `component` is one of the allowed values
- `value` is a valid number

---

**2. Implement a GET `/logs/summary` endpoint**
This endpoint should compute and return:
- Total number of stored events
- For each component:
    - Count
    - Minimum value
    - Maximum value
    - Average value
- The latest event (by timestamp)

Example response shape:
```json
{
  "count": 124,
  "components": {
    "battery": { "min": 68, "max": 76, "avg": 72.4, "count": 52 },
    "motor":   { "min": 61, "max": 95, "avg": 73.1, "count": 48 },
    "gps":     { "min": 0.0123, "max": 0.1290, "avg": 0.0567, "count": 24 }
  },
  "latest": { ... }
}
```

If no logs have been uploaded yet, return an empty or sensible fallback response.

---

**3. Requirements**
Your implementation should:
- Use clean, well-structured code
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include error handling and helpful error messages

---

**4. Include a short 3–5 sentence comment at the top of your file**
Explain:
- Your design decisions
- Any assumptions you’ve made
- Why you chose your storage strategy
- How you handled validation and errors

**Storage Assumption**
For this task, please assume the backend storage is simple in memory storage (e.g., an array).

You do not need to implement:
- any database
- file I/O
- caching layers
- persistence across restarts

Just briefly explain your choice in your comment block.
