# Question 3
## Infotainment System Design & Safety Considerations
##### Expected time: ~30 minutes

### Background
An infotainment system in a race car is not just a display, it is a safety critical interface between the driver and the engineering team.  

A poorly designed system can confuse the driver, hide important faults, or even cause dangerous distractions at race speeds.

At Sunswift, our infotainment system must deliver real time information, handle unreliable telemetry, and remain responsive, even under extreme vibration, temperature, and network conditions.
##### Your task:
Write a short structured response **(300–500 words)** addressing the following:

 **1. What makes a race car infotainment system different from a normal mobile app?**
Consider factors like:
- safety
- latency
- cognitive load
- update frequency
- environmental constraints
- error tolerance

---

 **2. Identify and explain _four_ key principles of good infotainment system design.**
Your chosen principles may include (but are not limited to):
- Fail-safe behaviour
- Predictability
- Minimal driver distraction
- Prioritisation of critical information
- Robustness to dropped or delayed telemetry
- Clear and consistent UI states
- Handling corrupted or partial data 
- Smooth degradation under failure

For each principle, explain:
- What the principle is
- Why it matters
- An example of what could go wrong if the principle is not followed

---

**3. Describe how you would test an infotainment interface to ensure it is safe and reliable.**
Include considerations such as:
- Stress-testing with rapid incoming telemetry
- Simulating network dropouts or corrupted messages
- Simulating extreme temperature and vibration
- Checking for UI freezes, rendering spikes, or memory leaks
- Testing driver readability and response time
- Logging and fault detection

---

**What we are looking for**
- Clear communication
- Good engineering reasoning
- Awareness of real-world constraints
- Thoughtfulness about driver safety
- Ability to connect software design to physical context
- Structured, professional writing
- 
### Bonus:
Use Figma or any other design tool to design a "Track Mode" screen to display live car data that a driver will find useful.
